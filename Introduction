Introduction/Business Problem:
Using the collisions data provided by Coursera for the final capstone course, I wanted to look into the number of car accidents that are due to bad weather conditions. 
How many car accidents are caused due to bad weather conditions? This data will bring awareness to people to drive extra cautiously during bad weather!
